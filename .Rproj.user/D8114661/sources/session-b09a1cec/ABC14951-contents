## Plots of BBA IT Sem 4 Results

In the multiple plots that we have been given below we clearly see the
number of students that have passed or failed in the subjects:

Management Science, Fundamentals of Financial Management, Research
Methodology, Web Technologies, Software Project Management, English for
Employability

                                rm_analysis,

                                english_analysis)
```

## RM Plot

This was an easy subject to score in, many students performed really
well in this subject since it is a theoretical subject, but since it is
more theoretical no student scored more than A+.

```{r RM,echo = FALSE}
rm_analysis
```

## FFM Plot

Oh ho, FFM man only 16 % students failed, i lost my money god damn. and
This Subject has the most students scoring O's. I guess I am a really
good motivator

```{r FFM,echo = FALSE}
ffm_analysis
```

## MS Plot

I hope this maam does not come next semester, I dont want to hear her grandfather's death, The score of MS is distributed fairly equally.

```{r CMA, echo = FALSE}
ms_analysis
```

## Web Technologies Result

Web Technologies, Very less failures this time.

```{r Statistics, echo=FALSE}
wt_analysis
```

## SPM Plot

Most of them scored really well for this exam.

```{r SPM,echo=FALSE}
spm_analysis
```

## UHVGS Plot

This was the most easiest subject out of all subjects and we can clearly
see in the graph that majority of students have scored excellent grades.

```{r es,echo=FALSE}
english_analysis
```

## Top 10 performing students

This semester the top 10 students performed are given below in the table
where most of the students had a tough time, these students passed with
an exceptional grade. This time Gurpreet has scored the best marks.

```{r top10,echo = FALSE,warning= FALSE}
top_10 <- results %>% filter(!is.na(SGPA))%>% 
  mutate(student.name = reorder(student.name,SGPA)) %>%
  arrange(desc(SGPA)) %>%
  head(10)
kable(top_10,"html") %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```
